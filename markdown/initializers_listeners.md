Note:
`ApplicationContextInitializer` -> Typically used within web applications that require some programmatic initialization of the application context. For example, registering property sources or activating profiles against the context's environment. See ContextLoader and FrameworkServlet support for declaring a "contextInitializerClasses" context-param and init-param, respectively.
